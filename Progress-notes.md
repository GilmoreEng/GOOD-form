| Gabe class| https://datasette.io server running at http://138.67.239.70/bldg  for student practice sql commands.
|CAAV event on SciVis | 11-12pm. 1900 - Print media, a delivery device for a story. Read and engage in conversation on that media. 1900 university lecture hall vs. movie theater. Then FB picuture collage of Van Gogh immersive how to engage the material where do you sit. Cave not much has changed- big room, really dark, glasses. Useful for bigvis. Research, manufactureing, simulation, training, ROI is siloed, and limited due to slow adoption. Also, LED tech for Esports Broadcasting HQ, etc. Marshal town, Iowa videio example in library. Not in a corner, not owned by a specific group. 31' by 12' size. LED can be used in daylight vs. projects require darkness. What is the MetaVerse? FB wants one thing Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). Naked eye 3d, aka looking glass, 14ft diang, lightbox display. 5-10 years at scale. Rapid maturing markats are esports, virtual tours, and construction design and management.  30ft mirrored orb in Resort World in Las Vegas, Hayward lobby. No so much the cost, but how its deployed and designed so it's engaging and useful. Content is king over hardware. NDI = Network Device Interface is a protocol for uncompressed streaming to any device.
