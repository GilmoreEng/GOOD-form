|Job discription Question? Do I enjoy the work I do?| This brings up a lot of questions. What is this job? Have I actually been doing this? When? Has this helped Mines become better getting research dollars? Does the Mines research community know how I can help? How best do I fit in to HPC/research/ITS? Is there a better place for the work that I'm finding myself actually doing that could be better serviced by being placed somewhere else within the organization?
