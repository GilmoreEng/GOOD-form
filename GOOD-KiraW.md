# GOOD 1:1 Meeting 
Name: Richard Gilmore & Matthew Ketterling
Date: 1-19-2023
## Goals/Projects/Items of Interest 
|Topic:|Update|
|:---:|:---:|
|Ease-of-Use for HPC| Desktop & Jupyter app code waiting for merge and deployment. Desktop app system level build not easily updatable to production.|
|VDI for HPC| Need to meet with Mike about VPC subnet connector to License Server.
|Class support for Jupyter Data Management CSCI 498A UG| Need to work through class updates.
|Business model deployment| Wendian OOD welcome page informational graphs on use and cost. Links to documentation, and interactive jupyter notebook.
|HR eval. Topics| Goal ideas review of last 8 months of work. 1. What would Cloud First look like? Conferences RMACC, SC22, etc. 2. Webpage and documentation: outdated information on visualization access now that OOD is functional enough to service ANSYS needs and VMD & OVITO needs. Easy learning for incoming graduate students until more senior member in a research group takes over teaching. 
|Job discription Question? Do I enjoy the work I do?| This brings up a lot of questions. What is this job? Have I actually been doing this? When? Has this helped Mines become better getting research dollars? Does the Mines research community know how I can help? How best do I fit in to HPC/research/ITS? Is there a better place for the work that I'm finding myself actually doing that could be better serviced by being placed somewhere else within the organization? 
|What are your thoughts on HPC for grant enablement?  How to estimate, costs, who should pay for it, etc.?| Matt. K. will talk to Walton in RTT for index number to support grants, and OPex transistion period for on-going grants that don't have funds for computing.


## Obstacles
|Identify roadblocks in the way of goal/project completion and overall employee success.|
|---|
|What are the services to the researchers that I can provide? at what cost? how many hours?
|Do researchers know what I can do for them? Free vs. Charge?|
|How many request can I handle?|Depends on if the software is build? depth and complexity of the model to load? Am I familar enough with the science domain to be useful.|


## Opportunities 
|Discuss new opportunities for further learning, development, and growth.|
|---|
|Math Club meeting - Transforming bad plots into good plots| Dr. Sprinkle will demonstrate the process of transforming bad plots into good plots. https://github.com/brennansprinkle/MATLAB_Figures_Demo See TOOL Plot optics for 3d creation of spheres.
|GSG Data Visualization Workshop | Next week Mar-1-2023 Data Visualization: This workshop led by Isabella Mendoza from Graduate Student Government will cover the basics for making data easy to read and visually appealing. https://libcal.mines.edu/event/10095672
