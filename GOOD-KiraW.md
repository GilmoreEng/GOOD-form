|TODO| Reorganize below to match above GRID view
|Fall Student Project | Github repo: https://github.com/TriHardStudios/F23_CSM_Gilmore. Need to integrate CS OOD Apps into new version. Building a dev env. with gxx gcc ruby python. *Mike* installed rh-devtool-11 gcc kit for compiling OOD apps on ondemand-dev. Ready to start working on this!

|Culture/Community|
|TDX/Service| Mina code for openMPS rebuild into shared project condaENV ADIT group. Yahya meetings Tues, and Wed. Commands journal files build for parameteric runs from Terminal. Running CFD-POST in Linux Desktop to post-process RMACC Alpine results. Apline run for new case solves 7% faster than Wendian with 64 vs 36 cores. 30sec flow-time is all that's needed not 1000sec. 30-sec solves in under a day so Apline is fast enough. Post-processing is the bottleneck. Hopefully, two nodes can be used to process data 732GB of data per run.
