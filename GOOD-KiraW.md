## Goals/Projects/Items of Interest 
|Topic:|Update|
|:---:|:---:|
|CAAV meeting this Friday|
|Ease-of-Use for HPC| Mio partition selection and AuNdebug with text for Compute7 and Compute. Need to add to Files app and desktop Projects and Sets for Gabe's Students. Propagated Partition code to all other apps. VMD and OVITO update needed with new Python Install.|
|VDI for HPC| Need to meet with Mike about VPC subnet connector to License Server.
|Class support for Jupyter Data Management CSCI 498A UG| Docker servicse running on MAC and Juptyer notebook connector using Python libraries. Mostly working. 
|Job discription Question? Do I enjoy the work I do?| This brings up a lot of questions. What is this job? Have I actually been doing this? When? Has this helped Mines become better getting research dollars? Does the Mines research community know how I can help? How best do I fit in to HPC/research/ITS? Is there a better place for the work that I'm finding myself actually doing that could be better serviced by being placed somewhere else within the organization? 
|HPC Business model Video | Downloaded and uploaded to Teams Files BizModel.
|What are your thoughts on HPC for grant enablement?  How to estimate, costs, who should pay for it, etc.?| Matt. K. will talk to Walton in RTT for index number to support grants, and OPex transistion period for on-going grants that don't have funds for computing.


## Obstacles
|Identify roadblocks in the way of goal/project completion and overall employee success.|
|---|
|What are the services to the researchers that I can provide? at what cost? how many hours?
|Do researchers know what I can do for them? Free vs. Charge?|
|How many request can I handle?|Depends on if the software is build? depth and complexity of the model to load? Am I familar enough with the science domain to be useful.|


## Opportunities 
|Discuss new opportunities for further learning, development, and growth.|
|---|
|Math Club meeting - Transforming bad plots into good plots| Dr. Sprinkle will demonstrate the process of transforming bad plots into good plots. https://github.com/brennansprinkle/MATLAB_Figures_Demo See TOOL Plot optics for 3d creation of spheres.
| ALL Champions CALL | XDmod overview and OnDemand. Account tracking app on OOD NOT Coldfront. XDmoD data ingess of SLURM accouting needs to parsed anyway to make $$$ account tracking. Python plugin would be better in OOD than another front end app.
|GSG Data Visualization Workshop | Next week Mar-1-2023 Data Visualization: This workshop led by Isabella Mendoza from Graduate Student Government will cover the basics for making data easy to read and visually appealing. https://libcal.mines.edu/event/10095672
