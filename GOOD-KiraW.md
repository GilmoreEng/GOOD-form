| Business model charge communcation | Thoughts? 
| Tickets | - 1. ANSYS Chemkin - Find test case to import chemkin library and UDF addon Fuelcell compatibility. PMDB file build on Windows machine ready to move to linux setup for debugging (NEEDS FOCUSED TIME). - 3: BOCS for GROMACS one of two built. Rebuild with Plumed. All complete! GPU support skipped. P100 too old? need container?
|Research R Studio Desktop install and then Ondemand App install | Gitlab repo cloned, working through code changes for use a Mines. Nick is building a new singularity container to run the desktop. Need to link to R that is optimized and not inside the container. 
|Ease-of-Use for HPC| Initiliazer configuation script coding. Dev Dashboard build need to make initializer script specific to partition owers, etc. |
| VDI for HPC | Need to meet with Mike about VPC subnet connector to License Server. Limited time to focus on development of this new service.
|Class support for Jupyter Data Management CSCI 498A UG| Giving up!
| Business model deployment | Dev Dashboard complete. Cloned current dashboard for testing announement widget that calls getUtilization. Is the text output correct from these "getUtilitzation"? Yes, -T Billing is used and not CPU hours. - Next steps custom message in announcement for user.
|AWS and POD for HPC | Need to looking lambda, and find SC22 Cloud provider notes. CHECK OUT. RMACC request put in at CU.  [Lancium compute for HPC](https://lancium.com/solutions/#solutions-lancium-compute) First look done! ALSO: [CloudyCluster](https://OmniBond.com) products OrangeFS CloudyCluster, TrafficVision - Amy Cannon amy@omnibond.com 8648887451 

## Obstacles
|Identify roadblocks in the way of goal/project completion and overall employee success.|
|---|
|What are the services to the researchers that I can provide? at what cost? how many hours?
|Do researchers know what I can do for them? Free vs. Charge?|
|How many request can I handle?|Depends on if the software is build? depth and complexity of the model to load? Am I familar enough with the science domain to be useful.|

## Opportunities 
|Discuss new opportunities for further learning, development, and growth.|
|---|
