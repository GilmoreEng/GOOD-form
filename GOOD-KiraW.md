# GOOD 1:1 Meeting 
Name: Richard Gilmore & Matthew Ketterling
Date: 1-19-2023
## Goals/Projects/Items of Interest 
|Topic:|Update|
|:---:|:---:|
|Ease-of-Use for HPC| Desktop & Jupyter app code waiting for merge and deployment. Desktop app system level build not easily updatable to production.|
|VDI for HPC| Need to meet with Mike about VPC subnet connector to License Server.
|Class support for Jupyter Data Management CSCI 498A UG| Need to work through class updates.
|Business model deployment| Wendian OOD welcome page informational graphs on use and cost. Links to documentation, and interactive jupyter notebook. Use Matt B. script as a starting point to pull data in. Prototype jupyter notebook script to plot data of users in Account group or user only.
|HR eval. Topics - NEED SMART GOALS FORMAT! | Review last 8 months of work. 1. What would Cloud First look like? Conferences RMACC, SC22, etc. 2. Webpage and documentation: outdated information on visualization access now that OOD is functional enough to service ANSYS needs and VMD & OVITO needs. Easy learning for incoming graduate students until more senior member in a research group takes over teaching. 3. Prof. Engagment - Class attendance, club attendance, research group meetings. Garritt, 3 class in the Spring. etc. 4. Professional Dev. - AWS learning, Conferences RMACC, SC22, Fall GTC22 and Spring GTC23. 5.  D&I engagement - DCA LGBTQ+, student discussion.
|Job discription Question? Do I enjoy the work I do?| This brings up a lot of questions. What is this job? Reveiwing job decription and making goals that relate. Have I actually been doing this? Not realy, more visualizatoin software support management and outreach. Bring in projects to the CIARC Team to work on. Reliate on Mike and Nick to implement stratigy. When? 
|Job discription Question? | Has this helped Mines become better getting research dollars? Does the Mines research community know how I can help? How best do I fit in to HPC/research/ITS? Is there a better place for the work that I'm finding myself actually doing that could be better serviced by being placed somewhere else within the organization? 
|What are your thoughts on HPC for grant enablement?  How to estimate, costs, who should pay for it, etc.?| Matt. K. will talk to Walton in RTT for index number to support grants, and OPex transistion period for on-going grants that don't have funds for computing.


## Obstacles
|Identify roadblocks in the way of goal/project completion and overall employee success.|
|---|
|What are the services to the researchers that I can provide? at what cost? how many hours?
|Do researchers know what I can do for them? Free vs. Charge?|
|How many request can I handle?|Depends on if the software is build? depth and complexity of the model to load? Am I familar enough with the science domain to be useful.|


## Opportunities 
|Discuss new opportunities for further learning, development, and growth.|
|---|
|Meeting with Mehmet and Neil to discuss NSF grant proposal| HPC related sustainability life cycle. https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23532/nsf23532.pdf and a paper on the topic: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9355319/references#references |
|Math Club meeting - Transforming bad plots into good plots| Dr. Sprinkle will demonstrate the process of transforming bad plots into good plots. https://github.com/brennansprinkle/MATLAB_Figures_Demo See TOOL Plot optics for 3d creation of spheres.
|GSG Data Visualization Workshop | Next week Mar-1-2023 Data Visualization: This workshop led by Isabella Mendoza from Graduate Student Government will cover the basics for making data easy to read and visually appealing. https://libcal.mines.edu/event/10095672
