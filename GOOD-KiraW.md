# GOOD 1:1 Meeting 
Name: Richard Gilmore & Matthew Ketterling
Date: 1-19-2023
## Goals/Projects/Items of Interest 
|Topic:|Update|
|:---:|:---:|
|Ease-of-Use for HPC| Update desktop app with Mio partition for owners. Work with Mike.|
|VDI for HPC| Striker is in surgury this week. May be back on Monday. Reachout on Monday to set up a meeting with David Griffth and Dave Striker.
|Class support for Jupyter Data Management CSCI 498A UG| Need to reach out to prof.
|Alex Pak class attended| Recieved feedback on HPC. Informed them of OnDemand interface options for VirtualGL apps on GPU. Major concern switching to OPX model.
|Job discription Question? Do I enjoy the work I do?| This brings up a lot of questions. What is this job? Have I actually been doing this? When? Has this helped Mines become better getting research dollars? Does the Mines research community know how I can help? How best do I fit in to HPC/research/ITS? Is there a better place for the work that I'm finding myself actually doing that could be better serviced by being placed somewhere else within the organization? 
|Gitlab tour|Commit a change, create new branch, and new merge request. Left side menu: Repository -> Graph shows history of commits. Click on one shows changes. Repository -> Files shows all the files, click on upperleft pull down menu changes Branch, i.e. Main to Jan26-meeting. File editing through "Blue button: Web IDE" edits this file. Bar,aka pipe keyboard character ends and begins columns.|
|New user experience? What's it like to learn HPC at Mines?| Domain science is very specific to the research. Software details are often left to the Research Groups to pass on to they're new users. Software build support and "layered", aka "Software Stack" is supported by Nicholas, for example: compilers (gcc, Intel, Fortran) matching to Networking communication software MPI is handled by Nick. Learning times for new users from their first touch to useful research can be longer than PI's would like. Who's resposibility is it to teach? Can OnDemand videos, software documentation be useful to write if it goes out of date?|
|HPC PI retention: How will the PI's react to the OPx model?| Retention, charging, support. How can we easy the transition? Communcation levels? Excalation model? Appeal model? True cost of use? Trainning cost? Student classwork cost?|
|Terminal use, sbatch, linux use tour| Ondemand access webpage: ease to use for file transfer, quick Graphical User Interface (GUI) startup, job composer, and terminal use. Job composer has example sbatch scripts to user ParaView as a server. sbatch file layout: #! (Shebang) calls this file a bash script. #SBATCH is a variable read by the sbatch command that give SLURM what it needs. All the following lines run command on the node in a "bash" terminal so to speak.|


## Obstacles
|Identify roadblocks in the way of goal/project completion and overall employee success.|
|---|
|What are the services to the researchers that I can provide? at what cost? how many hours?
|Do researchers know what I can do for them? Free vs. Charge?|
|How many request can I handle?|Depends on if the software is build? depth and complexity of the model to load? Am I familar enough with the science domain to be useful.|


## Opportunities 
|Discuss new opportunities for further learning, development, and growth.|
|---|
|Meeting with Dr. Kwon|Set meeting for Friday do discuss HPC offerings. See CRS in trailhead for Grants that are awards. Dr. Kwon has two funded and one pending. Questions to ask: Is your work computational? Do you often need custom graphics?

## Decisions
Agreed upon actions to be taken.
