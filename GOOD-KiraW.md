## 1st of NOVEMBER GOAL CHECK-IN
|Goal Name|Long Description| Milestones |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|HPC solution for research|	Work with the HPC Steering Committee to develop and deploy an HPC solution that meets the research computing needs by Q4. Support efforts in creating data surveys and options matrices in Q1, and assist in conducting RFPs and vendor selection in Q3. Assist Cloud Application Testing when needed and make recommendations for hardware purchases or workflow planning for the application stack. By the end of Q4, evaluate ease-of-use on the chosen HPC solution is successfully deployed and applications are set up for researchers. |	Q2: No specific tasks mentioned, likely focusing on ongoing support and planning. <br/> * Supported creation and curation of Condo model data.
|Expand SciViz offering, workshop, and awareness | Increase SciViz visibility on campus by meeting with 10 faculty members in Q1 to discuss needs, software, systems requirements, projects and training topics. Through these interviews create workshop material detailing a SciViz project workflow in Q2 to deliver in Q3. Curate 3 examples to publish as webpage content in Q4.| Q2: Create workshop content detailing SciViz workflow. <br/> * Expected meeting with Library orgainizer of Resarch Workshops in early December. <br/> * Develop vendor relation with ELUMENATI, and support and creation process for the OmniGlobe in CoorsTek.
|Test Visualization Software Workflows for Collaboration | Deploy OmniVerse Dev instance with approved access controls and basic configuration by Q1, ensuring seamless integration with existing Research Computing infrastructure. Obtain approval from Mines in Q1. Complete deployment of OmniVerse Dev instance in Q1. Conduct a basic configuration test to ensure access controls are functional, data storage is allocated correctly, and visualization tools can be accessed remotely in Q2.  | Q1: Deploy OmniVerse Dev. instance Q2-Q3: Integration tests from various SciViz softwares, and data sources (CFD, Geophysics, Molecular Dynamics, and other HPC softwares, etc.) <br/>  * Server racked and ready to deploy OS,  Mines approval, License received, and software downloaded. <br/> * Use case under way with demos for faculty involved in the VECTOR visualiztion for OER creation project.
| Ease-of-use access to HPC at Mines through improvements to Open Ondemand | Develop and deploy multiple scientific visualization applications. In Q1 build and deploy NORSAR for OOD. Q2, develop and deploy the Cloud Compare app for Geology, meeting their requested features and functionality. Q3, update Job Composer to include project templates with examples for Mio and Wendian, while also building and deploying the Job Reporting. |  Q2: New apps as requested by Geology: Cloud Compare. <br/> * Ready to test package manager instance of FLATPAK

## Goals/Projects/Items of Interest 
|Topic|Update|
|:---:|:---:|
|Expand SciViz offering, workshop, and awareness| Draft complete ready to review.
|OmniGlobe CoorsTek| Will get Unity Assest for content creation. Deep clean yearly maintance performed by Adam. Power down compute and blew heat sinks. Dusted projector lenses and powered them down. Recovered brightness on East projector. Realigned lens, and blended East facing side. Coltan and Adam will return to finish blending West side (wall facing) on Friday at noon. Clean dust off top and oiled dry spot facing tablet. NASA data now facing correctly on tablet vs globe displays. Enabled RDP for access. Need to open ticket to VLAN the network.
|Website content| https://cu-boulder-crdds.github.io/LearningMaterials/PythonDataViz.html. 
|Test Visualization Software Workflows for Collaboration| Need to reinstall with Entitlement and Enterprise version. Need code and architecture plan, code deployment, etc. Followed up for NVIDIA enterprise account license portal access and opened ticket# 21971252. Downloaded latest Omniverse Nucleus for Linux. No version for windows, etc.
|Ease-of-use access to HPC at Mines through improvements to Open Ondemand| Fix up JupyterLab Deployment, Document all changes in logs, copy code to github RC repo. Fix python envs in jupyterLab. Deploy MINES OOD apps at gibhub. Debugging Ruby code for YAML parsing of repeative code on MIO juypter app to start.
|Fall Student Project | Github repo: https://github.com/TriHardStudios/F23_CSM_Gilmore. Need to integrate CS OOD Apps into new version.
|Personal Development| "Unity Teaching BETA trainning:" Voucher recieved. Need to find the materials to review, and then schedule exam at Arvada RRCC testing center. Complete Group Fitness Instructor (GFI) course with the Recreation Center.
|Culture/Community| Attended "Securing Grants from Foundations" and "Mark III AI/ML Education Series: Introduction to Computer Vision". Attended Library Reseacher series end of semester Banquet, and Chilli Cook Off for the AFC.
|TDX/Service| Open OmniVerse entitlment license ticket. Gained access to enterprise download at NVIDIA. Closed ticket.
|On-prem Cluster| Tested Mike code for OOD new apps for agedu server interface, and debugged his code and workflow. Tested new OOD Active Job plugin for grahana CPU and Memory usage displaying job specific data to users. SSO isn't seemless, but functional with seperate login action. Troubleshooting wendian OOD Shell app with Mike after SLURM update was pushed. Returned Mio compute193 to service with less memory (updated slurm and nhc configure files). Reviewed OOD ansible code for ood_custompartitions.rb and configure setting for dynamic_js remains off. Ansys service pack 3 release: update forum post. It still fails in Linux Workbench
|Cloud/HPC IaaS| 
|Admin Automation App|
|Apps| Update OOD to new version of python module. Not pushed yet. Matlab 2024a rewrite html server app.
|Build CloudCompare| Uses FLATPAK manager in Q2.
|Vis&GUI| Look into v3.1 "my projects" which replaces "my templates".  Need test Mark III sys next notebooks and download datasets. Ready to release new version of JupyterLab and python 2024 as the base environment for OOD app.
|Website| Website Docs out of date need to update after workshop. See above. Also update SciVis offering. WPFILES is out. rc.docs is hosted on github pages directly! update can occur at anytime.
