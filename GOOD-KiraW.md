## Decisions
###Agreed upon actions to be taken.
|Topic|Decision|
|:---:|:---:|
|Cureate list useful tutorials | Data clean up tools, aka panads and holoviews, or Amazon Sagemaker. Need to be able to see dirty data to make judgement calls on clean up. Identify easy cleanup such as bad sensor data, static, and Not-a-Number. https://pointclouds.org/ is C++ PCL library with tutorials.
